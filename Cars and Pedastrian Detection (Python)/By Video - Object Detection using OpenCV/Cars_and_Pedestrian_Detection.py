'''
Steps:
Import openCV for gray scale conversion, so that algo run fast
Import video file format
Used already pre-trained model from Haar cascaded classifier
Created car and pedestrian classifier
Video reader to read our file
Gray conversion
Detect cars and pedestrian
draw rectangle around cars and pedestrian
Will display into color format
Q button to terminate
